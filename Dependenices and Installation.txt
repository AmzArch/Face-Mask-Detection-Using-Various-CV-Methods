Packages required to run this application:
pip install dlib
pip install tensorflow
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy


s_14.py is the Python application that uses the three methods to run face mask detection on either webcam feed or dataset
Usage (run detection on webcam): python3 s_14.py 1
OR
Usage (run detection on dataset): python3 s_14.py 0 <img folder>
The img folder has to contain two folders, one is called "without_mask" and one is called "with_mask", which contain images for each class accordingly


Three individual folders contain training code and models for each method

Datasets can be found below:
Dataset1:
