# Detection-of-Face-Mask-using-Three-Different-Methods-of-Computer-Vision

I completed the "Wearable Devices and Computer Vision" course at Harvard DCE, where the final project was a group project was to evaluate three methodologies on detecting face masks: edge detection, feature recognition, and machine learning classification for real-time video processing, proxied with a webcam. With this project, we will determine which method offers the highest accuracy and runtime performance (execution speed) in this broader, applied context. This project seeks to create three evaluative software implementations that can be applied to surveillance cameras to determine facility admission in real-time. Further study and application extension can be achieved by contextualizing mask identification such that those with inappropriate mask types (e.g. as types described in reference (1) ) are rejected for admission.
